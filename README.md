### THIS IS REST API BACKEND FOR [PHYSIO - FRONTEND](https://github.com/b-zuj/physio-frontend)

This project was created by [Maciej Glowacki](https://github.com/MaciejGL), [Stian Klasbu](https://github.com/mountwebs), and [Barbara Zujewska](https://github.com/b-zuj).

## What is PhysIO
PhysIO was our final project at the School of Applied Technology - we used 2 weeks to create an MVP that attempts to solve the covid-related issue. We chose to focus on the limited access to health care where due to lockdowns and physical contact restrictions many less urgent health issues are being overlooked. This is a big problem in physiotherapy where caretakers often send a list of exercises to their patients with at best a confusing illustration and a short description. Many patients have trouble following those instructions and as a result, their health suffers. This is why we decide to create PhysIO which allows physiotherapists to send their patients more customized workout plans with informative videos. 

At the current state, the app provides only the basic functionality, but starting in January 2021 we are planning to keep implementing additional features such as:
- expanding workout session/exercise customization and add session scheduling;
- add messaging functionality;
- implement remainders and notifications for clients.
